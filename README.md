# Data Visualization and Reproducible Research

> Matthew Russo 


The following is a sample of visualizations created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find mini-project-1, where I examined the trends in music across multiple decades using the Billboard Top 100 Summer Songs dataset, with the ultimate goal of finding what we needed to make a chart topping hit! I scored highly on this project, with the only revision needed being a simplification of a problematic bubble chart.

## Project 02

In the `project_02/` you can find mini-project-2, where I explored the FIFA 18 Players dataset, containing information on all the available players in the titular game, FIFA 18. I examined the nationalities of players, before going into a club-level analysis to determine what we should look for in a club, and by extension a player, if we want to build out a winning team.

(you can place your figures in the `figures/` folder and use the `![](path_to_picture)` option to add the pictures here)


## Project 03

In this project, after completing the mimic plots, I used text visualization on the Billboard Top 100 songs to build out a word cloud of the 200 most frequent words that appeared in song lyrics, and to build out an interactive plot showing each song with a sentiment score assigned based on the sum of the AFINN values of their lyrics.

### Moving Forward

Data Visualization was a course I didn't expect much from, but one that proved to be interesting and entertaining. I enjoyed learning about a different visualization suite with tidyverse + ggplot in R, and I enjoyed learning the principles behind Data Visualization, such as data storytelling and reproducible research.

My goals for the future involve game development, and I want to take these skills into that domain to help drive smart, player-conscious decisions that can help direct any project I end up on. Some examples that come to mind are using a boxplot to examine the distribution of player power faceted by class, or using data to spatially visualize where players are spending most of their time.
